  paragraph: For this project, we were tasked to study the style of Pablo Lobato and combine this with the Gestalt Principles. These principles include similarity, proximity, continuation, closure, and negative/positive space.
  paragraph2: We were asked to choose a well-known accomplished individual whom wasn't already styled by Pablo Lobato. They could be an actor, scientist, singer, mathematician, reporter, writer, musician, etc.
  paragraph3: We were then tasked with implementing the finished illustration into a layout of our choosing that related to our subject. Possibilities included—but not limited to—a newspaper, magazine, CD cover, DVD cover, book cover, cosmetic packaging, and food packaging. We were required to research and find examples, as well as study and measure these pre-existing layouts for accuracy.
